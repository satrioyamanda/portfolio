## Introduction

Besoksenin.co (formerly besoksenin.com) is a digital media portal that focus on provide fresh contents for the youth in Majalengka, Indonesia. They are the first media that position themself as youth media in Majalengka. Digital media they use is website, Instagram and Facebook.

Invited to take part in their strategic position as web developer, i need to create the new web of besoksenin because of the previous website (besoksenin.com) is technically hard to maintain and scale. And also, the CEO initiated a new name which is besoksenin.co. This project needs a new identity to be designed, and also it's me that handle it.

### Logo Design

### Web Design & Development

After the new identity made, this identity need to be placed on the new website. With the identity guideline, this website also need to follow those guideline to maintain identity consistency.
